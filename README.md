## Blur Face Using OpenCV

### Objective
> Recently, the media has become very advanced. As a result, even those who do not want their faces to be exposed may be exposed to the media. The person who edits the video also wants to cover the faces of people other than the cast. In that case, the face can be blurred in real time.

### Improvement Goal
- Recognize the shape of your hands so that you can turn off the mosaic and turn it on
- You can only see the face of the person who came out the biggest and blur the other person's face
